- I have just finished watching the begginers Figma tutorial, and now I am going to start creating a new project with it, and see what can I make.
- I've just finished my practice project on Figma. It was really easy, and it only took about half an hour. Now I'm going to start learning how to implement CSS, HTML and JS to Figma,
to create web pages with code, as I've been learning many time ago.
