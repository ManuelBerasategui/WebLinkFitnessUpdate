- I have just finished watching the begginers Figma tutorial, and now I am going to start creating a new project with it, and see what can I make.
- I've just finished my practice project on Figma. It was really easy, and it only took about half an hour. Now I'm going to start learning how to implement CSS, HTML and JS to Figma,
to create web pages with code, as I've been learning many time ago.
- I've spent almost 2 hours finishing the Figma begginers course, to learn what is it about. Also I started a new course wich is about
developing a landing page, focusing on CSS and style. I want to finish this course and see if there is anything else I can learn about 
web design, after the creation of 2 personal projects from what I learned.
